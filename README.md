Dental Office Location: Standalone Interactive Exercise 
==========

#### Background
You are a North Oralington licensed general dentist working in a private suburban practice when you are approached by Duane County's St. Cabrini Adolescent Health Center (AHC). They are seeking your assistance in expanding their health services to include an oral health program to serve the underserved poor/low income adolescents in the local neighborhood. Even though you don’t have extensive experience working with young adults, you agree to help.

#### Your charge
After estimating that you can set aside half a day each week from your primary practice, you agree to serve as a part-time dental consultant. You have been given the responsibility of choosing a physical site location for the dental program and advising on the overall operation and design.

The St. Cabrini board of directors would like to come present your recommendations and answer any questions regarding the program design. You are scheduled to present at their next board meeting in 4 days.

#### Adolescents module
This interactive is a small piece of the larger Adolescents module of [PASS](https://pass.ccnmtl.columbia.edu), a population-based approach to patient services and professional success. PASS was a five-year project to build a website with tools to educate pre-doctoral dental students about patient populations and how demographics play into decision of building a successful dental practice. The PASS content and interactives are being migrated to a sustainable home in the Health Resources and Services Administration [Train](https://www.train.org/) environment.

This and other interactives were developed by the Columbia University [College of Dental Medicine](http://dental.columbia.edu/) in collaboration with the Columbia University [Center ror Teaching & Learning (CTL)](http://ctl.columbia.edu).
